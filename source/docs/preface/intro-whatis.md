title: What is PostgreSQL?
---
[PostgreSQL][pgsql] is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) based on [POSTGRES][postgres], Version 4.2, developed at the University of California at Berkeley Computer Science Department. [POSTGRES][postgres] pioneered many concepts that only became available in some commercial database systems much later.

[PostgreSQL][pgsql] is an open-source descendant of this original Berkeley code. It supports a large part of the SQL standard and offers many modern features:

- complex queries
- foreign keys
- triggers
- updatable views
- transactional integrity
- multiversion concurrency control

Also, [PostgreSQL][pgsql] can be extended by the user in many ways, for example by adding new

- data types
- functions
- operators
- aggregate functions
- index methods
- procedural languages

And because of the liberal license, [PostgreSQL][pgsql] can be used, modified, and distributed by anyone free of charge for any purpose, be it private, commercial, or academic.
